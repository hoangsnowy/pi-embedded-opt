# Rules
- Read the plan.md and current.md in order to continue the next moves.
- Update the current.md to correct state of the project.
- Do not hardcode secrets; use environment variables or secret stores.
- Follow repository code style; meaningful names, guard clauses, small functions.
- Build as publish trimmed, single-file, self-contained for `linux-arm64`.
- Do not run as root inside containers; use non-privileged `USER`.
- Expose only required ports; prefer `ASPNETCORE_URLS` binding to `0.0.0.0:8080`.
- Prefer read-only filesystem in tuned mode; write to `tmpfs` only.
- Add healthcheck endpoints and probe readiness before traffic.
- Keep dependencies minimal; prefer runtime-deps base image.
